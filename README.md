# Project
This repository contains the code for developing a cross-validation method eager to tackle an oversampling problem in Machine Learning. The method implements KDE or Kernel Density Estimation to oversample minority class examples
from a biological dataset.
The method runs on several binary and multiclass datasets from the [CUMIDA repository] (https://sbcb.inf.ufrgs.br/cumida#datasets) by considering a discrete imbalance ratio between the classes. The set of selected datasets for the experiment can be downloaded from the following [link] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zB5xFM9qrurKZjgKxmVpv4QKcaXUCSJY?usp=drive_link)
